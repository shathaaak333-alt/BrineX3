# 🌊 BrineX: Integrated Brine Management System

## Overview
This application merges Machine Learning (Ridge Regression + Softmax) with Engineering Rule-Based logic to optimize brine treatment. It supports both **Single Point Simulation** and **Batch File Processing**.

## Batch Processing Features
If your uploaded CSV/Excel file is missing required columns (e.g., Sodium or Location), the app automatically detects this and provides input fields for you to manually specify these values for the batch.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
